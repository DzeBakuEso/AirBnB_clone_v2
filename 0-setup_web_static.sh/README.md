## Background Context
This project focuses on deploying your **web_static** work from the AirBnB Clone. You'll use **Fabric**, a Python library and CLI tool for streamlining SSH-based tasks like transferring files, executing commands locally/remotely, and managing deployments. This marks your first deployment project, ensuring your web servers (from **0x0F. Load Balancer**) are fully utilized for real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Understand what **Fabric** is and how it simplifies deployments.
- Deploy code to servers efficiently.
- Create and work with `.tgz` archives.
- Execute Fabric commands locally and remotely.
- Transfer files using Fabric.
- Manage **Nginx** configurations, including using `alias`.
- Differentiate between `root` and `alias` in Nginx.
